Key Findings:

CLASSIFICATION REPORT:

Class 2 has perfect performance (precision, recall, and F1-score of 1.00), indicating that the model can correctly classify every instance of this class.

Class 0 performs very well with high precision (0.98), recall (0.99), and F1-score (0.98), suggesting the model is very accurate in predicting this class as well.

Class 1 has a slightly lower recall (0.93), indicating that the model misses some instances of this class. However, the precision (0.97) and F1-score (0.95) still show solid performance.

The overall accuracy of 98% indicates that the model is performing excellently, with only a small portion of incorrect predictions.

Conclusion:
The model performs excellently on the Stellar Classification Dataset with a high overall accuracy and balanced metrics for precision, recall, and F1-score.
The slightly lower recall for Class 1 could be improved by fine-tuning the model, especially if Class 1 instances are critical to identify.
Class 2 is being predicted perfectly, while Class 0 also shows strong performance, making this model highly reliable for star classification tasks.

CONFUSION MATRIX:

This confusion matrix shows a model's performance classifying galaxies, QSOs, and stars.
It excels at identifying galaxies and stars, with high correct classification rates.
However, there's notable confusion between galaxies and QSOs, with some QSOs being misclassified as galaxies.  
Further analysis is needed to understand and address this issue for better overall performance.
