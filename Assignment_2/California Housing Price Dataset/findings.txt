Key Findings:


MAE (Mean Absolute Error): The MAE values are quite similar for both models:

Ridge: 49478.63
Lasso: 49484.47
Both models have nearly identical MAE, indicating similar performance in terms of the average magnitude of errors.


MSE (Mean Squared Error): The MSE is also similar but shows slightly higher values for the Lasso model:

Ridge: 4662500751.29
Lasso: 4664572248.56
This suggests that Lasso has slightly larger squared errors, which may indicate it is more sensitive to larger deviations in certain instances.


RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Similar to MSE, the RMSE values are higher for Lasso:

Ridge: 68282.51
Lasso: 68297.67
This confirms that the Lasso model has a slightly higher magnitude of error overall compared to Ridge.


Conclusion:
Ridge Regression outperforms Lasso Regression by a small margin based on all three metrics (MAE, MSE, and RMSE).
The differences are not large but suggest that Ridge Regression has marginally better predictive accuracy and is less affected by large errors than Lasso in this particular dataset.
